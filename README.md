Develop an application that allows a user to view, add, update, and delete users
from a list.

The estimated time for this task is a maximum of 4 hours - when you reach it, let’s have a call regardless of the features you delivered. 

The idea is to have a practical conversation about your craftsmanship, such as technological choices, engineering excellence, mindset, and approach. 

Consider it as a Pull request review.
